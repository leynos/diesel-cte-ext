## PostgreSQL test support

This crate uses `pg-embed-setup-unpriv` for PostgreSQL-backed integration tests
because embedded PostgreSQL setup crosses process, filesystem, and privilege
boundaries. Keeping that behaviour in a dedicated helper avoids scattering
directory ownership, PostgreSQL binary caching, password file handling, and
cluster lifecycle policy through this crate's tests.

The dependency is especially important for sandboxed agentic development. These
workspaces often run automation as `root`, while PostgreSQL refuses to
initialise or run as `root`. `pg-embed-setup-unpriv` detects that case,
prepares the runtime and data directories with the permissions PostgreSQL
expects, and delegates lifecycle commands to a worker helper that drops to the
`nobody` user. The test harness can therefore keep its original process
identity without mutating the effective user ID mid-test.

Local PostgreSQL tests should prefer the existing `pg-embed-setup-unpriv`
helpers instead of starting PostgreSQL directly. This keeps root and
unprivileged execution paths aligned, preserves deterministic environment
variables such as `PGPASSFILE` and `TZDIR`, and makes failures easier to
diagnose in Continuous Integration (CI) and agent sandboxes.
